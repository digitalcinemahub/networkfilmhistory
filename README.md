# Network Analysis and German Film History

The data you find here was collected as part of the research for a paper on National Film History. It includes data on key contributors (direction, production, screenwriting, camera, editing, set design, music, actors/actresses) of German feature films from the time period between 1919 and 1939 which was gathered from [Filmportal.de](https://www.filmportal.de/). For each year a network analysis was carried out in order to elaborate the (in-)stability of this network of contributors along the time and in connection with political changes.

The data here is presented in two formats: As csv-files representing the nodes and edges of the network for each year and as gefx-files as a standard format which can be used with different kinds of network analysis tools.
